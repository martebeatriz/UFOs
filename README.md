# UFOs

## Overview of Project:
Using JavaScript, HTML, and Bootstrap, we used a JavaScript file with data on UFO sightings and displayed them on a website. 

We also added filters for the city, state, country, and shape to make sorting through the data easier. 


### Results: 
With the filters applied, users can see data based on city, state, country, and/ or shape. 

For example, if the user wanted to see sightings in El Cajon, CA, they could enter “el cajon” in the City box and see all 5 sightings in that city. This will include citing from different dates and with different types of shapes seen.

The user can further filter to see sightings in El Cajon on 1/1/2010 by adding “1/1/2010” in the Date box and they would see 4 sightings. Including 3 different types of shapes.

In this example, the user added “light” in the Shape box. With all three filters added, only one result is presented.

### Summary: 

These filters are a great tool for users to sort through the data. However, one drawback is that the input boxes are case-sensitive. If the user enters “CA” for California instead of “ca” as is used in the data chart, the table will not reflect any data. My recommendation will be that the input boxes be updated to recognize case sensitivity. Another recommendation is to add a “Clear” button. The way the website is set up, users have to clear all data manually or refresh the page in order to clear the filters.
